Performance Analysis of Ethernet Packet Transmission in Multi-kernel OS           Sep.2018-Dec.2018
Language: Shell

Designed experiments to evaluate performance of communication between processes executing on separate virtual machines in different system configuration in Multi-kernel operating system empirically.
Utilized iperf to run experiments over TCP and UDP protocol to assess virtual networking performance of Ethernet Packet Transmission in Multi-kernel operating system environment, respectively.
Concluded that communication between processes executing on separate virtual machines in a multi-kernel environment within one computing node can have similar performance to classical kvm virtual machines hosted by single Linux host.
